This is the [online version](https://csgillespie.github.io/mbml-rstan-book/) of the book: [Model-Based Machine Learning and Probabilistic Programming using RStan](). Pull requests and general comments are welcome.

To build the book:

1. Install the latest version of R
    * If you are using RStudio, make sure that's up-to-date as well
1. Install the book dependencies.
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    # Make sure you are using the latest version of `devtools`
    # Older versions do not work.
    devtools::install_github("emaasit/mbml-rstan-book")
    ```
1. Clone the mbml-rstan-book [repo](https://github.com/Emaasit/mbml-rstan-book)
1. If you are using `RStudio`, open `index.Rmd` and click `Knit`.
    * Alternatively, use the bundled `Makefile`

[Daniel Emaasit](http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~ncsg3/) is a Ph.D Student of Transportation Engineering at UNLV, where his research interests involve the development of probabilistic machine learning methods for high-dimensional data, with applications to urban mobility, transport planning, highway safety, & traffic operations.

He is also a Research Intern at IBM Research - Africa, an organizer of several Data Science and R Meetup groups and actively contributes to open-source technologies in the R community.

# Preface {-}

*Model-Based Machine Learning and Probabilistic Programming using RStan* is about increasing the amount of work you can do with R in a given amount of time. It's about both *computational* and *programmer* efficiency. There are many excellent R resources about topic areas such as visualisation [e.g. @chang2012r], data science [e.g. @grolemund_r_2016] and package development [e.g. @Wickham_2015]. There are even more resources on how to use R in particular domains, including Bayesian Statistics, Machine Learning and Geographic Information Systems. However, there are very few unified resources on how to simply make R work effectively. Hints, tips and decades of community knowledge on the subject are scattered across hundreds of internet pages, email threads and discussion forums, making it challenging for R users to understand how to write efficient code.
